    <p class="desc">A blog is a special-purpose Web site that enables one person or a small number of people to
    post news or updates, usually focused on a narrow topic. They're also used as public journals for people as 
    well for significant events that have happened in their lives.</p>

    <p class="desc">Video hosting sites such as Youtube enables most anyone with a computer or mobile phone and an
    Internet connection to create video and distribute it widely. They're also important complements to social
    network sites; a Facebook or Twitter user, for example, can incorporate a link to Youtube video into a status
    update, and members of that user's network can, in turn, share the original link with members of their network.
    Furthermore, when the business or organizations makes a video available on a video hosting site as part of a promotion 
    or campaign, the business or organization can share the link through social networks and invite interested customers
    or clients to spread the news.</p>
